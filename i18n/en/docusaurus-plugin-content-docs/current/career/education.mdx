I finished the Master's program in Applied Mathematics at National Aviation University in 2013.
Applied Mathematics is like Mathematics but with a minor focus on practice-based application.
I still can't say how different it is, but we had Mathematical equations in Physics and 
some basic programming. Later, in 2018-2020, I even taught some programming to students there myself.

From 2013 to 2016, I was doing post-graduate studies investigating image processing and machine learning.
Later that year, I presented my thesis with a developed prototype for GIS (geographic information system)
for agricultural purposes â€“ photographs taken by UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles, drones) were analyzed with geographical data,
and the quality and state of the crops were assessed, to define geographical coordinates of the areas that needed
additional attention.

That last thing was accepted, and I became a Candidate of Technical Science (PhD analogue) in Information Technologies.

So now I can brag about it!
