### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Viktor K, I am using different names online - glukozavr since early 2000s, but also glukozavrius, glukozavrua and others when my original one is occupied. Glukozavr is a fancy word based from gluk, or "**Ò‘Ð»ÑŽÐº**" in Ukrainian, which can mean different things - from a dream to a hallucination, or a bug in software and games. Combined with a dinosaur to emphasize on the size or amount and to sound a bit cooler. It was in high school when I got called like that by a friend for the first time and I liked it (before that I used Shrek as a nickname, so that kind of an improvement).
