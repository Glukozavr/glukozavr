In summer 2022, after the full-scaled Russian invasion in Ukraine, together with my friend and past partner on Stub Games we started to work on the mobile crafting tower defense game. This game wasn't a success, but I still love it. I wrote something like a post-mortem about it in my blog, called [Another Drop in the Ocean](https://notpublicopinion.com/another-drop-in-the-ocean/).

It was released on iOS (already dropped), Android (already dropped) and itch.io ([available installer for Windows](https://glukozavr.itch.io/territorial-defense-the-game)).
