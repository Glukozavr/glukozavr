Working with amazing people at NetEnt, I met a few who, like me, wanted more and felt like a kindred spirit.
So after some time, I suggested to build our games as a hobby together. And they liked
the idea. We decided to make a simple project with a short timeline to see how it works. We came up
with an idea of one, but then came over a game jam event that summer, in 2020. It was a hypercasual game jam.
As we wanted to try working together and see how it goes with a small project, we agreed that it could also be a good
opportunity to try ourselves. That's how we built Way of Ray - our first game together. We didn't win anything,

That would be it, but we got contacted by a publisher to test the game for a CTR (Click-Through-Rate). And while it didn't go through to make us any money, it succumbed to the industry. We learned the basics of the hypercasual market and decided to give it a go. Make a few games, develop the process, polish our skills with tools, and get a chance to earn money for the studio. That's how Stub Games came to be. We worked on this for over a year, built 18 game prototypes, worked with 6 publishers, and got some minor amount, but we have yet to reach sustainability. Ultimately, I felt burned out from working on games at a pace I didn't enjoy. I felt like a gold digger, and with no success in the first year, I thought it was not how I wanted to work for a more extended period.

But it was a very interesting journey and an important learning experience for me.
