I have liked to write for a long time and missed the "live journal age," so I have never had a blog as is.
I did post in many places, like on [Medium](https://medium.com/@glukozavr) or a few articles on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/viktor-kurochkin-gkzr/). But I struggled with deciding what to write and where. My indecisiveness usually led me to forsake the thing. In the end, I found [Ghost](https://ghost.org/)—a very fair platform with all the right values. And I decided to create something like a blog—**Not Public Opinion**.

The scope of the blog is wide—games, technology, and stuff. While I think and write about games a lot, I am also an engineer, and I want to share my thoughts about that as well. But I also have interesting, boring, or weird thoughts about other stuff that I want to share.

I am not yet consistent with publishing, but I decided that all my stuff will be there. If you find it fun – feel free to [subscribe](https://notpublicopinion.com/) and be sure you won't get spammed!

P.S. I created the logo myself, and it originates from the Ukrainian name – Не Суспільна Думка. Initially, I wanted to post in English and Ukrainian, but I eventually dropped the idea. But still, I share some bits of Ukrainian here and there.
