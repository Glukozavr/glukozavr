# About Me

![Hello There](../static/img/hello-there.webp)

My name is Viktor. Viktor K.

I am a Ukrainian living in Sweden. Work as a Frontend Game Architect, I program in JavaScript/TypeScript,
leading engineers and work closely with management to make better technical decisions. Also I love games.
I enjoy reading â€“ fiction, non-fiction. Also got excited with HEMA (Historical European Martial Arts) and
fence few times a week! I am married. Also I write. 

But let's go step-by-step.
